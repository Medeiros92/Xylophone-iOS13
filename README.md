# Xylophone

## This is a Swift language learning project, in the iOS & Swift course - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp with Professor and Doctor Angela YU on the Udemy platform. In this project I developed these basic xylophone just for learning and I intend to improve it further with all the knowledge I acquire.
